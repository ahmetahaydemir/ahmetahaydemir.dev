This week I spent some time on how will I input my data, in what format I will store it and how will the data be retrieved.

I don't think this step is a one and done process. it will change and get refactored as I continue developing the project.

But I still think it would be beneficial to take some time to ponder about the overall picture.

## Data Format

I need the data format to be easily readable and modifiable by hand since I will be dealing with it constantly while building it.

My plans in the building phase does not involve any complicated interactions. No need to reinvent the wheel and I don't think the file size will be an issue as well, so I will format everything as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

Then at some point, I would like to migrate my static data to a `relational database`, preferably to the same database where dynamic visitor data will be stored.

## Data Seperation

In terms of usage, I will be having a set of static data that I will only read and never write. These will be :

-   Entity Base Data
    -   Battle Entity Data
    -   Rest Entity Data
    -   Event Entity Data
    -   Treasure Entity Data
-   Object Base Data
    -   Equipment Object Data
    -   Node Object Data
    -   Spawn Object Data
-   Class Base Data
-   Origin Base Data
-   Skill Base Data
-   Configuration Data

I will also need a set of dynamic data that I will read and write constantly. These will be :

-   Node Simulation Data
-   Node Map Data
-   Player Team Data
-   Player Progression Tracker
-   Player Configuration Preferences

## Data Fetching

One of my main goals was to build a prototype environment with my data set to see the shortcomings of my project structure. In order to do that I will be replicating the game data in this website with several visual components.

Since the data will have an exact replica in here, I will just create a couple static file endpoints that I can use as an API route.

Then I can use these endpoints to stay in sync and try out different data sets while using Unity.

-   https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/api/getEntityData.json
-   https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/api/getClassData.json
-   https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/api/getOriginData.json
-   https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/api/getSkillData.json
-   https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/api/getObjectData.json
-   https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/api/getConfigData.json

This will allow me to update the data once in that static endpoint and see the results in the website and the game simultaneously.

Building a website is much easier than developing a game, so it will be faster to prototype and visualize the data in here.

In the future, let's say that this game has more than 10 players, maybe a community member would like to tinker around with game data. These public endpoints will also provide them with the data they need.
