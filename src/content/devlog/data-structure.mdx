This week I spent some time on how will I input my data, in what format I will store it and how will the data be retrieved.

I don't think this step is a one and done process. it will change and get refactored as I continue developing the project.

But I still think it would be beneficial to take some time to ponder about the overall picture.

## Data Format

I need the data format to be easily readable and modifiable by hand since I will be dealing with it constantly.

My plans involve web related network interactions as well, no need to reinvent the wheel and I don't think the file size will be an issue, so I will format everything as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

## Data Seperation

In terms of usage, I will be having a set of static data that I will only read and never write. These will be : 

- Entity Base Data
- Class Base Data
- Origin Base Data
- Skill Base Data
- Equipment Base Data
- Configuration Data

I will also need a set of dynamic data that I will read and write constantly. These will be : 

- Node Simulation Data
- Node Map Data
- Player Team Data
- Player Progression Tracker
- Player Configuration Preferences

## Data Fetching

One of my main goals was to build a prototype environment with my data set to see the shortcomings of my project structure. In order to do that I will be replicating the game data in this website with several visual components.

Since the data will have an exact replica in here, I will just create a couple static file endpoints that I can use as an API route.

Then I can use these endpoints to stay in sync and try out different data sets while using Unity.

- http://localhost:3000/wild-chess-simulator/api/getEntityData.json
- http://localhost:3000/wild-chess-simulator/api/getClassData.json
- http://localhost:3000/wild-chess-simulator/api/getOriginData.json
- http://localhost:3000/wild-chess-simulator/api/getSkillData.json
- http://localhost:3000/wild-chess-simulator/api/getEquipmentData.json
- http://localhost:3000/wild-chess-simulator/api/getConfigData.json

This will allow me to update the data once in that static endpoint and see the results in the website and the game simultaneously.

Building a website is much easier than developing a game, so it will be faster to prototype and visualize the data in here.

In the future, let's say that this game has more than 10 players, maybe a community member would like to tinker around with game data. These public endpoints will also provide them with the data they need.

## Data Structure - Entity

```typescript
import type { SkillData } from "./SkillDataStructure";
import type { TeamEffectData } from "./TeamEffectDataStructure";

export interface EntityData {
    Identifier: string;
    Origin: TeamEffectData;
    Class: TeamEffectData;
    Rarity: number;
    Health: number;
    Power: number;
    Defence: number;
    Speed: number;
    Range: number;
    Skill: SkillData
}
```

## Data Structure - Class

```typescript
import type { SkillData } from "./SkillDataStructure";

export interface ClassData {
    Identifier: string;
    EffectArray: EffectData[];
}
export interface EffectData {
    Size: number;
    Description: string;
    Skill: SkillData;
}
```

## Data Structure - Origin

```typescript
import type { SkillData } from "./SkillDataStructure";

export interface OriginData {
    Identifier: string;
    EffectArray: EffectData[];
}
export interface EffectData {
    Size: number;
    Description: string;
    Skill: SkillData;
}
```

## Data Structure - Skill

```typescript
export interface SkillData {
    Identifier: string;
    Type: SkillType;
    CastData: CastData;
    TriggerData: TriggerData;
    OccurenceData: OccurenceData[];
}
export interface CastData {
    Point: number;
    Type: CastType;
    TargetingInput: TargetingInput;
    TargetingRange: number;
}
export interface TriggerData {
    Type: TriggerType;
}
export interface OccurenceData {
    TargetingInput: TargetingInput;
    MultiplierData: MultiplierData;
    StatisticChanges: StatisticChange[];
    StatusChanges: StatusChange[];
    SpawnChanges: SpawnChange[];
}
export interface MultiplierData {
    Type: MultiplierType;
}
export interface StatisticChange {
    TargetStat: StatisticType;
    FlatChange: number;
    PercentageStat: StatisticType;
    PercentageChange: number;
    PercentageBasedOnCaster: boolean;
}
export interface StatusChange {
    Status: SkillData;
}
export interface SpawnChange {
    Spawn: string;
}
