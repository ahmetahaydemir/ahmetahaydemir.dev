Now that the gameplay loop is documented, I will be focusing on the sections that I defined in there, one by one in isolation to get them to their **MVP** stage. This section is not the most critical one; but it is the first scene the visitors will see.

So, I will start from here as well. Here is the visualization of the overall interface framework I am going to implement :

## Home View

In terms of components, there is not much in this view. We only have :

- **Button :** P2P, Settings, Library
- **Text :** Server Notification
- **Passive Object :** Current World Origin
- **Active Object :** Current Team Save State

Here is how this home view looks like for now. It should be enough for what I have visualized in the interface diagram.

Some world origins look nice, some look weird. So I will need to re-visit the color scheme and accessories assigned to each origin later down on the road.

## Library Progression View

This section resembles the library I have on my site. I was planning to skip this part in game; because of my explanation in this [previous devlog](https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/devlog/gameplay-loop#landing-menu). But tracking the progression of your library discovery is something I really want and I am already going to create most of the required components while coding that anyways.

Since adding the library functionality does not add extra effort to my work plan, I will add it in game as well.

I guess **laziness** did not win after all : )

Here is how the scene looks like for now. I will definitely re-visit this view to add scenery accessories. Right now, it just has the core layout and functionality I drew in the framework.

## Settings Panel

I am going to include an audio section, preferences section and current run section in there. Usually there would be also a controls section where you map the inputs. Right now, my only concern is desktop keyboard and mouse. So that part will not be necessary in MVP stage.

Also this is not a view, it is a panel. So it will be opened in other sections as well. Toggle will be bind to top left button or ESC keyboard input.
