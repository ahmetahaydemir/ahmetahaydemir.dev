The title is quite dramatic; but after my [accidental time skip](https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/devlog/accidental-time-skip), I struggled a bit to get familiar with the project once again and organize my backlog.

Here is a line trend graph that showcases my determination for the project over time. ðŸ“‰

It moves slowly; but I am getting back on track. Next week, I going to take my parents on a tour to celebrate my father's retirement. I took pre-cautions in order to not fall to this situation again, so hopefully I will be fine.

Here is a summary of what I have realized and done in these two weeks.

## What Did I Do?

There were soooo many edge cases with skills and simulations that I overlooked while developing. So I started to develop a seperate scene that can simulate matches in parallel and test the results on whether there are any errors or not.

For now tests are done manually. Due to the outcome of these tests I've changed these :

-   Realtime-ish simulation advancement creates confusion for player and limits the freedom for skill variety. 
    -   Switched back to `awaiting entity's action` before moving to the next one.
    -   Actions can have `varying await times` whether its skill, attack or movement
    -   Only idle actions skip await process

-   Reduced the amount of levels you need to complete before fighting the last boss from `5+1 Zones` to `4+1 Zones`. 
    -   Might even cut it more and adjust it to the regular `3+1 Zones` formula if the progression feels sluggish.,

-   Reduced the amount of zones from `10` to `6+2`.
    -   Before this every origin had its own zone which acted as levels which caused some issues with content distribution.
    -   Now there are `6 normal zones` and `2 final zones` which contains a larger set of content.

-   Re-designed the color scheme generator depending on the zone.
    -   Looks like the `Hue-Saturation-Value` combination gives more reliable results visually compared to RGB modifications

-   Post simulation analysis timeline now works properly. You can see how it looks in the video below.
    -   First functionality is `JumpToStep` which moves board to the exact state before that turn executed its action.
    -   Second functionality is `AdvanceStep` which executes the step with its await processes if there are any.

## What's Next?

-   Handle entities that have more than `1x1` cell size,
    -   Refactor skill and attack targeting to handle entities with more than `1x1` cell size
    -   Refactor pathfinding to handle entities that have more than `1x1` cell size
-   Finish the parallel testing scene implementation
-   Re-evaluate the ideal maximum team size and gold progression
-   Implement the first `boss node` prototype
-   Start the content generation cycle for entity skills and statistics ( Right now the variation is limited to class )
-   Visual mesh accessory variation per zone ( Right now only the color scheme changes )
