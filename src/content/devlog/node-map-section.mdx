After a long break, I am back on the development cycle. Its funny how my own code looks foreign to me after just two weeks of not coding. Memory is a fickle thing, especially mine : ) 
 
Right now I am focusing on the shop and node graph section. Here is what I have done for now.

## Shop View

[Re-roll and enhance functionalities I have planned](https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/devlog/gameplay-loop#node-map) to have for the shop has not changed. `Re-roll` cost is dependent on the shop pool size. `Enhance` is used to increase the shop pool size.

One additional feature I am planning to add is the `reset/reduction of pool size` to counter balance spam enhancing early. If it never resets, common sense will be enhancing whenever you can mindlessly. 

In order to avoid that, I will add some kind of way to *reduce the pool size*. Like when a specific event occurs, **level completion** or **entity purchase**. This looks like something I can *A/B test* and decide accordingly when I have the chance.

At some point, I also want to add additional effects for **enhancing beyond a certain pool size**. But for now, increasing the pool size alone will be enough.

In its current state, shop just checks the current zone data and simulation configuration to showcase entities for you to buy/sell.

-   **-Starting Coin** : 6
-   **-Enhance Cost** : 2
-   **-Re-roll Cost** : Pool Size
-   **-Interest Gain** : 10 to 1
-   **-Shop Slots** : [ 0 -> 18 ]
-   **-Party Slots** : [ 4 -> 8 ]
-   **-Bench Slots** : 8

## Node Graph

I still use the [same procedural generation script I have used for basic gameplay prototype](https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/devlog/gameplay-loop#node-map). I decided that I don't need any fancy algorithms for this. I am controlling the distribution of node types by hard-coded rules.

I tried some other implementations for procedural generation; but during my testing phase the simulations I have run had more consistency with the hard-coded version. 

And if I tune the algorithm enough to where it creates consistent results, it performed similar to the hard-coded implementation. 

It basically made sense to go cave men style 👁️👄👁️

Ideal Scenario is player encountering `4 Battle, 2 Event, 1 Rest, 1 Treasure, 1 Elite, 1 Boss` nodes per zone. Rules described below achieves the distribution I want per path.

-   **-Row Count** : 10
-   **-Column Count** : [ 2 -> 4 ]
-   **-Node Type Chance - Event** : [ 30% Starting Chance && 15% Roll Increment && After 1st Row ]
-   **-Node Type Chance - Rest** : [ -25% Starting Chance && 10% Roll Increment && After 3rd Row with 9th Row Boost ]
-   **-Node Type Chance - Treasure** : [ -25% Starting Chance && 10% Roll Increment && After 4th Row with 9th Row Boost ]
-   **-Node Type Chance - Elite** : [ -25% Starting Chance && 10% Roll Increment && After 3rd Row ]
-   **-Node Type Chance - Battle** : [ If Last Row ]
-   **-Node Type Chance - Boss** : [ Default Case ]

Each node is a component that can be serialized, so that I can save the state of the procedural map and load accordingly during transitions.

For a node in row 0, the serialized data looks something like below.

```json
        {
            "nodePosition": {
                "x": -2.0660080909729006,
                "y": 0.5,
                "z": 2.3622310161590578
            },
            "nodeIndex": {
                "x": 0,
                "y": 0
            },
            "mapListIndex": 0,
            "nodeTypeDataName": "BattleNodeData",
            "nodeTypeEncounterVariationSeed": 1698682,
            "nodeInputLine": [],
            "nodeOutputLine": [
                {
                    "startIndex": 0,
                    "endIndex": 4
                },
                {
                    "startIndex": 0,
                    "endIndex": 5
                },
                {
                    "startIndex": 0,
                    "endIndex": 6
                }
            ]
        }
```

## Remaining Tasks

There were some things I wanted to spend time on while building this scene; but none of them were MVP scoped so I restrained myself from working on them : )

-   -- Zone specific mesh changes and accessories, right now only the color scheme is updated
-   -- Starting camera animation to showcase map on level start, so that the player gets a quick glance of the paths
-   -- Finishing camera animation to showcase map after completing the level
-   -- Shop animation and HUD differentiation per interaction, right now I don't feel the **oomph** while using the shop. That's best way I can explain the problem with my 5 IQ points.
-   -- Node type tooltip or legend, right now each node type is represented by a chess piece. Some people might not recognize them, especially since these are [amateur models made by me in a past game jam](https://ahmetahaydemir.itch.io/very-interesting-chess).
