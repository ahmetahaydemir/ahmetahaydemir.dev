I have returned back from my family trip. I got that farmer's tan going on from lack of protection.

It was quite exhausting, mostly because I am not used to driving this much in a short amount of time. Might be a skill issue :(

Main goal of the trip was to spend time with my parents and acclimate my dad to his new lifestyle since he is newly retired.

We went back and forth on the coast of black sea and climbed what plateau we could. I tried to select locations where they wanted to see and acted like I wanted to see them. Classic trickery üï∫

As a terminally online person, I don't get that excited about vacations anyways, so its all fine. 

There were some nice views along the way. Here are some shots in case you like nature stuff üèîÔ∏è

It was all worth it in the end when I saw how happy they were once the trip was over.

Now its time to get back on completing the remaining tasks I mentioned in [the last devlog](https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/devlog/refactoring-&-remembering).

And that's that. Not much to update on this log.

Just wanted to make a short note of it to remember what happened in this time slot and share some of the views üíæ

Should be fun to review in retrospective.
