As the title suggests, I made an accidental time skip and forgot to work on my project for over 3 weeks.

I am looking at my code and it feels like a stranger to me üòê We grew apart, like long-distance lovers ‚ù§Ô∏è In order to save this relationship, I am going to do a hard refactor to the code base and cut some content.

Meaning that even though I am back working on the project, I will not progress further. It will take some time to get it going again. It is kinda scary how foreign it feels : )

If I have no progress to share, then why am I writing a devlog? To waste more time?

I wanted to log what I have spent my time on kinda like a self-retribution. 

So, what did I do instead?

## Tech Content Creators

None of the content creators I follow were tech related before. All of them were entertainment oriented or people I have been watching over 10 years and got attached.

Recently I got into these 3 content creators and consume a lot of tech related news and hobbies through their contents.

-   [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen)
-   [ByteByteGo](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteByteGo/featured)
-   [Theo-t3.gg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg/featured)

I learned so much by just consuming their content, especially [ByteByteGo](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteByteGo/featured). So many of these technical topics that I would require to invest in a lot of time to understand is now easily fed into my little puny brain.

Most of my time has gone to them and I do not regret it.

## WebSocket & Socket.io

I learned a lot about the type of connections, protocols and such. I have never delved deep into networking related stuff, it felt magical how realtime connection worked the first time I tried it.

WebSocket and Socket.io were both relatively easy to use and understand due to the abstraction of the APIs. I have written a multiplayer clone of Wordle with tournament format and hosted it on a Google App Engine.

Here is a screenshot of me and my family playing it ‚ù§Ô∏è

The application lives on this link, anyone can play it unless I take it down due to the passive cost of running serverless services.

## Electric Guitar

I listen to a lot of [Ichika Nito's](https://www.youtube.com/@ichika_nito) work and love it. I've also recently watched an anime called [Bochi the Rock](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock), it was decent. Not great not bad, but it led me to initiate a new daily hobby. 

I never tried learning an instrument before and no one in my family or friends knew how to play one too.

I taught it would be cool to get good enough to create some sounds for my game projects. So I bought one.

Now I also reserve some time daily to learn it üé∏

My fingers don't listen to what my brain says, help üêµ

## Friends & Family

The classic, not much to say. Can't live with them, can't live without them.

## Handling Back Pain

It got to a point where I can't sit straight and focus more than an hour in front of my pc, so I started dealing with it. A normal 26 years old male shouldn't be this decrepit : )

Daily streching sessions, using a pilates ball from time to time instead of a chair and a home pull up rack/station to do quick exercises where I take the weight off my back.

These three helped a lot and I can sit comfortably again. Hoping that it stays that way.

## Up Next

As I stated in the start, I will do a refactor to get familiar with the code again.

Then continue from where I left, which is focusing on the simulation arena section.
