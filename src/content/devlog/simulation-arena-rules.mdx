There are so many things I have to decide in terms of how the code will execute the simulation.

One of the main functionalities I want is the [playback feature](https://ahmetahaydemir.dev/wild-chess-simulator/devlog/gameplay-loop#simulation-phase). It is the main reason why I went with grid-based execution.

Simulation should have the *deterministic* features of a **turn+grid based simulation**; but also flow like a **real-time simulation**.

I will try to explain my thought process for each node type simulation.

Then hopefully, I can start implementing them one by one.

## Turn Cycle

First thing to decide was what kind of turn cycle I will be having. Simulations are categorized by what node type we are currently in. `Battle`, `Elite` and `Boss` simulations will take some turn to finalize; but `Event`, `Rest` and `Treasure` simulations can be done in an instant.

I think the turn cycle visualized below covers the interactions I want. Middle section can be skipped for non-battle simulations that take 0 turns. Each turn's action list will be executed while the turn cycle is moving to the next step in a fixed time slot.

So `Node Start(0)` actions would be seen in the `Next(+1)` step. We would check whether the simulation has concluded at each incerement. If it did, execute it as the `Node End(X+1)` step. If it did not end, repeat the cycle.

I was planning to use `Event` simulations as a wildcard; but for now it looks like I generalized it with other 0 turn types.

## Turn Execution

At each turn cycle step participants will have a set of actions that they will take. Participants are `entities` and `objects`. 

They can have certain types of actions per turn and those `actions` can trigger `sub-actions` via `skills` and `effects`.

My initial implementation was trying to seperate **decision** and actual **execution** steps to two parts. I would start deciding what to do per entitiy in each team index. Then execute them all at once. Kinda like what I visualized below.

This made it really hard to understand what entity took what action in that turn. Especially when the team sizes were large. 

Also since the execution happens all at once, I was quite limited by what I can animate; because an entity might be dead at the end of that turn. Or an entity might decide to attack another entity in its range; but during that turn, target entity might have moved away from its attack range.

This order of execution acted equal to both teams and *worked* fine; but in terms of **watching the simulation**, it was a mess.

Next execution order I tried was the back-and-forth between team indices. Basically the first member of player team, first member of enemy team, then move on to the next index.

Main difference for this implementation was that now we don't move on to the next step before completing **decision + execution** for that entitiy. So an execution from a specific entity might cancel out another entitiy down the cycle (Kill it, stun it etc.).

It works fine... But this process will start bothering me once I implement a PVP content like dueling; since one of the players will have the execution priority. I did not want one of the parties to have an upper hand. But then again, it is the same in chess♟️. 

So maybe it fits the theme : )

## Action Execution

In order to have a **real-time** look; but actually function on a **turn-based** simulation, the timings that each action might take should be specific. Each turn will move on to the next step in a fixed time slot and the same goes for actions.

If the actions of one of the entities has not finished before one of the other entities targets it, it might create a similar chaos with the first turn execution method I have used.

And if I create enough room for a time difference variation, it will expose the turn-based simulation to the eye while the other entities are waiting. Right now, there are 5 main actions an entity can take that turn.

Main thing I pay attention to avoid the issue I described above is completing targeted actions like `Attack` & `Skill` before any movement simulation initiates. 

And also resuming the order of execution without waiting for the recovery animations. So the earliest I can continue is 20% and the latest is 50%. Now I can fake a real-time look if I keep the time slots small enough.

## Visual Aspect

I can't say that I am completely done with the implementation I described above; but here is how it looks with the order of execution I have described above. Note that some entities are just slow themselves, so they take the idle action to gather action points most of the time. ( https://youtu.be/gyH4wP-8KiU )
