This is the documentation for `Wild Chess Simulator` game development project I am working on.

It is basically a project I started after playing [Super Auto Pets](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714040/Super_Auto_Pets/) and [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/). I will take the cool things from both of them and add my own spin.

The goal is to finish it, publish it on Steam and develop it until I am out of ideas for this project. It would be also nice if a small community is also built along that way, but that is a distant dream.

I will develop it regardless to experience what it is like to **maintain a desktop game**.

Especially a rogue-like since it is my favourite genre ❤️
